# Symptom Translator

To translate symptoms of speakers of one language to another language for use in medical diagnoses.
Meant to address problem of misdiagnoses by obscure communication of body parts between doctors and patients.
If I ever get back to this, I'd want to be able to add languages in real time by scraping Translate results.

Back-end only; more practical UI was through Android Studio.
